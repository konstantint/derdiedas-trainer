# Der-Die-Das Trainer

This is a simple web app to assist in learning German word articles. It is powered by Google's Gemini AI to generate words on a chosen topic. The words are illustrated by images that are colored blue, red or yellow depending on the word's article. Hopefully, this should help with memorization.
You can play with the image prompt in the settings to adjust the style of generated images.
To use this application, you must provide your own Gemini API key, which you can obtain for free from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
This entire application was 100% "vibe-coded" with Gemini.
